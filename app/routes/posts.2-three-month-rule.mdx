# The 3-Month Rule: When to Quit Your Side Hustle

Every new project deserves a fair shot, but not an endless runway. That's why I live by the 3-month rule: set a clear goal and timeline for every side project.

Your benchmark? Look for genuine traction signals:
- Consistent user growth
- Emerging revenue streams
- Meaningful user engagement

If after three months you're not seeing movement in these areas, it's time to make a hard decision. Pivot or walk away. The indie hacker's secret weapon isn't persistenceâ€”it's agility.

The sunk-cost fallacy is a killer of dreams and potential. Just because you've invested time doesn't mean you should continue investing. Your ability to recognize when something isn't working is just as valuable as your ability to build.

**Remember**: In the world of indie hacking, flexibility is your greatest asset.
