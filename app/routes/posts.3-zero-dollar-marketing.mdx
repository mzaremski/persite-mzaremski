# The $0 Marketing Plan That Landed 100 Users

Forget everything you've heard about needing a massive marketing budget. Your network is your most powerful marketing tool.

Here's exactly how I acquired 100 users in just two weeks, spending absolutely nothing:
- Personally emailed 50 contacts in my network
- Posted thoughtfully in 3 niche, relevant forums
- Shared my authentic startup story on LinkedIn

The result wasn't just user acquisitionâ€”it was relationship building. Indie hacking isn't about massive ad spends. It's about genuine connections and providing real value.

**Key Insight**: Your first 100 users are rarely strangers. They're people who already know, trust, or are intrigued by you.
