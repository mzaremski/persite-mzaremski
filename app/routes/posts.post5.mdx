# Indie Hacker Burnout: Why I Work 4-Hour Days

Productivity isn't about grindingâ€”it's about strategic consistency. I made a counterintuitive decision that transformed my work: switching to 4-hour workdays.

The approach is simple but powerful:
- Ruthlessly prioritize high-impact tasks
- Eliminate low-value work
- Focus on deep, meaningful progress

The results were remarkable: more meaningful progress, zero burnout, and sustained creative energy. By working less, I actually achieved more.

**Core Principle**: Your goal isn't to work more hours. It's to make those hours count.

Success isn't about how many hours you put in. It's about the quality of those hours and your ability to maintain long-term momentum.

Hack your schedule, and you'll hack success.
